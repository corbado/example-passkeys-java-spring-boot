This guide provides a sampling of how {spring-boot}[Spring Boot] helps you accelerate
application development. As you read more Spring Getting Started guides, you will see more
use cases for Spring Boot. This guide is meant to give you a quick taste of Spring Boot.
If you want to create your own Spring Boot-based project, visit
https://start.spring.io/[Spring Initializr], fill in your project details, pick your
options, and download a bundled up project as a zip file.

== What You Will build

You will build a simple web application with Spring Boot and add some useful services to
it.

== Learn What You Can Do with Spring Boot

Spring Boot offers a fast way to build applications. It looks at your classpath and at the
beans you have configured, makes reasonable assumptions about what you are missing, and
adds those items. With Spring Boot, you can focus more on business features and less on
infrastructure.

The following examples show what Spring Boot can do for you:

- Is Spring MVC on the classpath? There are several specific beans you almost always need,
and Spring Boot adds them automatically. A Spring MVC application also needs a servlet
container, so Spring Boot automatically configures embedded Tomcat.
- Is Jetty on the classpath? If so, you probably do NOT want Tomcat but instead want
embedded Jetty. Spring Boot handles that for you.
- Is Thymeleaf on the classpath? If so, there are a few beans that must always be added to
your application context. Spring Boot adds them for you.

These are just a few examples of the automatic configuration Spring Boot provides. At the
same time, Spring Boot does not get in your way. For example, if Thymeleaf is on your
path, Spring Boot automatically adds a `SpringTemplateEngine` to your application context.
But if you define your own `SpringTemplateEngine` with your own settings, Spring Boot does
not add one. This leaves you in control with little effort on your part.

NOTE: Spring Boot does not generate code or make edits to your files. Instead, when you
start your application, Spring Boot dynamically wires up beans and settings and applies
them to your application context.

== Starting with Spring Initializr

You can use this https://start.spring.io/#!type=maven-project&language=java&packaging=jar&jvmVersion=17&groupId=com.example&artifactId=spring-boot&name=spring-boot&description=Demo%20project%20for%20Spring%20Boot&packageName=com.example.spring-boot&dependencies=web[pre-initialized project] and click Generate to download a ZIP file. This project is configured to fit the examples in this tutorial.

To manually initialize the project:

. Navigate to https://start.spring.io.
This service pulls in all the dependencies you need for an application and does most of the setup for you.
. Choose either Gradle or Maven and the language you want to use. This guide assumes that you chose Java.
. Click *Dependencies* and select *Spring Web*.
. Click *Generate*.
. Download the resulting ZIP file, which is an archive of a web application that is configured with your choices.

NOTE: If your IDE has the Spring Initializr integration, you can complete this process from your IDE.

NOTE: You can also fork the project from Github and open it in your IDE or other editor.

== Create a Simple Web Application

Now you can create a web controller for a simple web application, as the following listing
(from `src/main/java/com/example/springboot/HelloController.java`) shows:

====
[source,java]
----
include::initial/src/main/java/com/example/springboot/HelloController.java[]
----
====

The class is flagged as a `@RestController`, meaning it is ready for use by Spring MVC to
handle web requests. `@GetMapping` maps `/` to the `index()` method. When invoked from
a browser or by using curl on the command line, the method returns pure text. That is
because `@RestController` combines `@Controller` and `@ResponseBody`, two annotations that
results in web requests returning data rather than a view.

== Create an Application class

The Spring Initializr creates a simple application class for you. However, in this case,
it is too simple. You need to modify the application class to match the following listing
(from `src/main/java/com/example/springboot/Application.java`):

====
[source,java]
----
include::complete/src/main/java/com/example/springboot/Application.java[]
----
====

include::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spring-guides/getting-started-macros/main/spring-boot-application-new-path.adoc[]

There is also a `CommandLineRunner` method marked as a `@Bean`, and this runs on start up.
It retrieves all the beans that were created by your application or that were
automatically added by Spring Boot. It sorts them and prints them out.

== Run the Application

To run the application, run the following command in a terminal window (in the `complete`)
directory:

====
[subs="attributes"]
----
./gradlew bootRun
----
====

If you use Maven, run the following command in a terminal window (in the `complete`)
directory:

====
[subs="attributes"]
----
./mvnw spring-boot:run
----
====

You should see output similar to the following:

====
[source,text]
----
Let's inspect the beans provided by Spring Boot:
application
beanNameHandlerMapping
defaultServletHandlerMapping
dispatcherServlet
embeddedServletContainerCustomizerBeanPostProcessor
handlerExceptionResolver
helloController
httpRequestHandlerAdapter
messageSource
mvcContentNegotiationManager
mvcConversionService
mvcValidator
org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.MessageSourceAutoConfiguration
org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.PropertyPlaceholderAutoConfiguration
org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.web.EmbeddedServletContainerAutoConfiguration
org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.web.EmbeddedServletContainerAutoConfiguration$DispatcherServletConfiguration
org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.web.EmbeddedServletContainerAutoConfiguration$EmbeddedTomcat
org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.web.ServerPropertiesAutoConfiguration
org.springframework.boot.context.embedded.properties.ServerProperties
org.springframework.context.annotation.ConfigurationClassPostProcessor.enhancedConfigurationProcessor
org.springframework.context.annotation.ConfigurationClassPostProcessor.importAwareProcessor
org.springframework.context.annotation.internalAutowiredAnnotationProcessor
org.springframework.context.annotation.internalCommonAnnotationProcessor
org.springframework.context.annotation.internalConfigurationAnnotationProcessor
org.springframework.context.annotation.internalRequiredAnnotationProcessor
org.springframework.web.servlet.config.annotation.DelegatingWebMvcConfiguration
propertySourcesBinder
propertySourcesPlaceholderConfigurer
requestMappingHandlerAdapter
requestMappingHandlerMapping
resourceHandlerMapping
simpleControllerHandlerAdapter
tomcatEmbeddedServletContainerFactory
viewControllerHandlerMapping
----
====

You can clearly see `org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure` beans. There is also a `tomcatEmbeddedServletContainerFactory`.

Now run the service with curl (in a separate terminal window), by running the following
command (shown with its output):

====
[source,text]
----
$ curl localhost:8080
Greetings from Spring Boot!
----
====

== Add Unit Tests

You will want to add a test for the endpoint you added, and Spring Test provides some
machinery for that.

If you use Gradle, add the following dependency to your `build.gradle` file:

[source,groovy,indent=0]
----
include::complete/build.gradle[tag=tests]
----

If you use Maven, add the following to your `pom.xml` file:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::complete/pom.xml[tag=tests]
----

Now write a simple unit test that mocks the servlet request and response through your
endpoint, as the following listing (from
`src/test/java/com/example/springboot/HelloControllerTest.java`) shows:

====
[source,java]
----
include::complete/src/test/java/com/example/springboot/HelloControllerTest.java[]
----
====

`MockMvc` comes from Spring Test and lets you, through a set of convenient builder
classes, send HTTP requests into the `DispatcherServlet` and make assertions about the
result. Note the use of `@AutoConfigureMockMvc` and `@SpringBootTest` to inject a
`MockMvc` instance. Having used `@SpringBootTest`, we are asking for the whole application
context to be created. An alternative would be to ask Spring Boot to create only the web
layers of the context by using `@WebMvcTest`. In either case, Spring Boot automatically
tries to locate the main application class of your application, but you can override it or
narrow it down if you want to build something different.

As well as mocking the HTTP request cycle, you can also use Spring Boot to write a simple
full-stack integration test. For example, instead of (or as well as) the mock test shown
earlier, we could create the following test (from
`src/test/java/com/example/springboot/HelloControllerIT.java`):

====
[source,java]
----
include::complete/src/test/java/com/example/springboot/HelloControllerIT.java[]
----
====

The embedded server starts on a random port because of
`webEnvironment = SpringBootTest.WebEnvironment.RANDOM_PORT`, and the actual port is
configured automatically in the base URL for the `TestRestTemplate`.

== Add Production-grade Services

If you are building a web site for your business, you probably need to add some management
services. Spring Boot provides several such services (such as health, audits, beans, and
more) with its
http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/{spring_boot_version}/reference/htmlsingle/#production-ready[actuator module].

If you use Gradle, add the following dependency to your `build.gradle` file:

[source,groovy,indent=0]
----
include::complete/build.gradle[tag=actuator]
----

If you use Maven, add the following dependency to your `pom.xml` file:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::complete/pom.xml[tag=actuator]
----

Then restart the application. If you use Gradle, run the following command in a terminal
window (in the `complete` directory):

====
[subs="attributes"]
----
./gradlew bootRun
----
====

If you use Maven, run the following command in a terminal window (in the `complete`
directory):

====
[subs="attributes"]
----
./mvnw spring-boot:run
----
====

You should see that a new set of RESTful end points have been added to the application.
These are management services provided by Spring Boot. The following listing shows typical
output:

====
[source,text]
----
management.endpoint.configprops-org.springframework.boot.actuate.autoconfigure.context.properties.ConfigurationPropertiesReportEndpointProperties
management.endpoint.env-org.springframework.boot.actuate.autoconfigure.env.EnvironmentEndpointProperties
management.endpoint.health-org.springframework.boot.actuate.autoconfigure.health.HealthEndpointProperties
management.endpoint.logfile-org.springframework.boot.actuate.autoconfigure.logging.LogFileWebEndpointProperties
management.endpoints.jmx-org.springframework.boot.actuate.autoconfigure.endpoint.jmx.JmxEndpointProperties
management.endpoints.web-org.springframework.boot.actuate.autoconfigure.endpoint.web.WebEndpointProperties
management.endpoints.web.cors-org.springframework.boot.actuate.autoconfigure.endpoint.web.CorsEndpointProperties
management.health.diskspace-org.springframework.boot.actuate.autoconfigure.system.DiskSpaceHealthIndicatorProperties
management.info-org.springframework.boot.actuate.autoconfigure.info.InfoContributorProperties
management.metrics-org.springframework.boot.actuate.autoconfigure.metrics.MetricsProperties
management.metrics.export.simple-org.springframework.boot.actuate.autoconfigure.metrics.export.simple.SimpleProperties
management.server-org.springframework.boot.actuate.autoconfigure.web.server.ManagementServerProperties
----
====

The actuator exposes the following:

* http://localhost:8080/actuator/health[actuator/health]
* http://localhost:8080/actuator[actuator]

NOTE: There is also an `/actuator/shutdown` endpoint, but, by default, it is visible only
through JMX. To http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/{spring_boot_version}/reference/htmlsingle/#production-ready-endpoints-enabling-endpoints[enable it as an HTTP endpoint], add
`management.endpoint.shutdown.enabled=true` to your `application.properties` file
and expose it with `management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=health,info,shutdown`.
However, you probably should not enable the shutdown endpoint for a publicly available
application.

You can check the health of the application by running the following command:

====
[source,bash]
----
$ curl localhost:8080/actuator/health
{"status":"UP"}
----
====

You can try also to invoke shutdown through curl, to see what happens when you have not
added the necessary line (shown in the preceding note) to `application.properties`:

====
[source,bash]
----
$ curl -X POST localhost:8080/actuator/shutdown
{"timestamp":1401820343710,"error":"Not Found","status":404,"message":"","path":"/actuator/shutdown"}
----
====

Because we did not enable it, the requested endpoint is not available (because the endpoint does not
exist).

For more details about each of these REST endpoints and how you can tune their settings
with an `application.properties` file (in `src/main/resources`), see the
the http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/{spring_boot_version}/reference/htmlsingle/#production-ready-endpoints[documentation about the endpoints].

== View Spring Boot's Starters

You have seen some of
http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/{spring_boot_version}/reference/htmlsingle/#using-boot-starter[Spring Boot's "`starters`"].
You can see them all
https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/tree/main/spring-boot-project/spring-boot-starters[here in source code].

== JAR Support and Groovy Support

The last example showed how Spring Boot lets you wire beans that you may not be aware you
need. It also showed how to turn on convenient management services.

However, Spring Boot does more than that. It supports not only traditional WAR file
deployments but also lets you put together executable JARs, thanks to Spring Boot's loader
module. The various guides demonstrate this dual support through the
`spring-boot-gradle-plugin` and `spring-boot-maven-plugin`.

On top of that, Spring Boot also has Groovy support, letting you build Spring MVC web
applications with as little as a single file.

Create a new file called `app.groovy` and put the following code in it:

====
[source,java]
----
@RestController
class ThisWillActuallyRun {

    @GetMapping("/")
    String home() {
        return "Hello, World!"
    }

}
----
====

NOTE: It does not matter where the file is. You can even fit an application that small
inside a https://twitter.com/rob_winch/status/364871658483351552[single tweet]!

Next, https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/{spring_boot_version}/reference/htmlsingle/#getting-started-installing-the-cli[install Spring Boot's CLI].

Run the Groovy application by running the following command:

====
[source,bash]
----
$ spring run app.groovy
----
====

NOTE: Shut down the previous application, to avoid a port collision.

From a different terminal window, run the following curl command (shown with its output):

====
[source,bash]
----
$ curl localhost:8080
Hello, World!
----
====

Spring Boot does this by dynamically adding key annotations to your code and using
http://www.groovy-lang.org/Grape[Groovy Grape] to pull down the libraries that are needed
to make the app run.

== Summary

Congratulations! You built a simple web application with Spring Boot and learned how it
can ramp up your development pace. You also turned on some handy production services.
This is only a small sampling of what Spring Boot can do. See
http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle[Spring Boot's online docs]
for much more information.
